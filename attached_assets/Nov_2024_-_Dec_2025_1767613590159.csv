I was so confused and perplexed. I spoke about it for hours with ria, advaith, mama. I got the clarity that I needed. Even ahmed helped me out and told me his perspective. I knew what I wanted deep inside. I just kept trying to think of the bad times. And in fact, it really still wasn't enough to get me over her. If that conversation went the way I was feeling it could maybe shift while speaking to her, I would be in such a different place. But the fact is that when she said those things, I felt so so bad. I was heart broken because I put every dying thought into her and that relationship and we spoke for hours and hours and for tosay all that was just the nail in the coffin I needed. I didn't have the courage but I'm glad that I could feel it from her side as well. I needed to get out of it so bad. Oh got. It was so painful. So so painful. The journey of the end. Post that I've really been feeling better. I've been feeling relaxed, in peace knowing my desicion was truly correct because now she doesn't exist in my head as a possibility and that's just so relieving. I just know how wrong I would be doing myself. And I am not scared to admit that I was so scared to leave. I lacked the courage, but had the willingness to get through with it. I just keep imagining my life with her and it wouldn't be happy and the love I comprehend love to be. SO yeah, I am really happy. Also got a haircut and walked so much downtown with Andy.

I don't know why. I guess it was just that I was operating with people in completely different wavelenghts. You know. But I guess I was struggling to find a way to ensure that I am part of the conversation. I don't want to look stupid. I want to look like I am good at conversationsl. I have to be more patient, positive, and listen better. I have to be more receptive to conversations from their side. Take time and think of your answer. Don't just rush to conculsions you know. Went for grocery shopping with ayush and spoke a bit about ani with him. Try keeping most of it on the down low. It's not for him to hear. Say it with people you are comfortable with.  Biked back home. Instatly went to the gym and went for a shirtless jog which was soo much fun! Ended up playing monopoly till pretty late actually which was quite surprising considering I was also so in the mood to just sleep in. But it is what it is. Quite fun but remember don't over hangout.

Anyway, went to the little portugal side. I also noticed that I got pretty nervous again this time in the beginning when I met that girl. Why? I'm not entirely sure. I get pretty nervous when I first meet people nowadays. Or I also guess it depends on my mood. Get that feeling out of your mind.Remember no one is permanent and how you act is completely valid. Be kind, funny, light hearted, and loving. THAT'S IT. Life is that simple. Had a hot dog, chicken samosa, got hot sauce in the toronto night market. Lots of fun.

Back and bis building gym,Sunday,07/13/2025,"Hey, you're now within your mind. you're free to speak and feel. You are who you are here. But to provide yourself with some direction, let's talk about your observations of their livelihood and your views of their life and how/what you want and expect from your journey. I predominantly want to live in the city because I need people. Why? I actually don't like a lot of types of people. And I really have the choice to avoid these people. I feel like in the process of meeting so many people, you sort of forget how to speak for yourself and how you feel truly and deeply. You can never be your full self with those people because there is a chance of them of leaving. I feel like the issue is you somewhat in a very deep level are looking for validation from people. you want to be liked, in the office or outside office to some extent. And you're scared that if they don't like you and you don't like them, the world will fall apart. In the process of that, you mask what you really want to say and feel at some points. I remember that in the past, I didn't think twice who I was speaking to, I just was so open. and the people who like you and you like will attract eventually.  Remember that your connection with other people should not define how you feel. Their reaction to what you say should not define how you feel. I am permanent and I KNOW who I AM. That is all and all that matters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Had chicken breast and then went towatch the baseball game. Lot of fun. I was feeling a little low and quiet. Not sure why exactly in hindsight. I was feeling a little judged and felt like this slight distance at somepoint which I kind of do because I'm scared of being myself and getting rejected for it. So now I just stay a bit quiet and do the same to someone else instead just because I think I'm cooler. And by someone else I mean my sister who I keep telling doesn't know much. I faced what she faced for so long and absolutely hated it. If she doesn't know something. I should show her instead rather than shutting her down. That's just immature and not forming this kind of common talking point. So maybe you could sit down and explain everything you know about this and talk to her about it because no one will otherwise. Right? Atleast give it a shot maybe. Anyway then we went back home and mama made khichdi which I didnt eat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had sandwiches in the morning and then we went to TGIF and had TASSTYY food and amazing vibes. Was very happy and wholesome. Then we went to niagara falls and it was so so beautiful. But honestly the falls is incomplete without the people around you. If you were alone, your mind would be on trying to have someone around you to share this special moment with. I have a strong family and although we all are very different in our own ways, we are still one and come together and choose each other every single time. Anyway, then we went for the cruise which was heavenly. We had mist trickling onto all of us which felt like raindrops falling. Enjoyed every moment. Then we went through the touristic side of things and checked out rainforest cafe. We then walked back home and got a subway. Slept till 8 then went to the jacuzzi.

Went to tim hortons and got lot of food then took the wego bus and reached the train. Stood outside the train which was honestly a boilingly hot experience. In the train had a very introspective experience for about 2 hours about my relationship and preceding events which felt relieving for where I am now. Free and open to do what I want. I am grateful for the step I had taken at that point of time and to not look back for even a second from that decision. And don't forget that last few days when you kinda just wanted to get our of there - the hotpot day. It was just not the right frame of mind - not the right person. We just weren't. And I'm happy that I have another opportunity in life to spend it with someone who I can have a better connection with. Who I can laugh with on my wavelength. Who doesnt have so much emotional baggage. Who's more free and would open me up more. Any way, reached back home and went to the gym and had a great workout.

Its your last few days in the city! Relax and live free. Go out, listen to the pumped up fun music. Be free. Dont feel any sad emotions. Only be happy, nothing else. Whats troubling you? Like actually, is it yesterday and ayushs friends? Is it the fact that you cant get a validation for how you were yesterday and thats stressing you out? Because you need to know how you were? Because you need to know the impression that you made on people? This is the insecurity that she built in you. This is the part of you that has to change. You are scared. You are scared of being you. You believe others are perceiving you and forming an opinion about you. But let me ask you a question, the perception you have created of everyone has been positive right? No negative perception. Then why feel any opposite negativiity. What else, the flevin interaction? Is that what's troubling you? Is it the fact that you wanted to chat with that guy and you feel flevin heard and thinks that you want to be in commercial banking giving you a feeling of insecurity? Why? The samer way his perception was formed suddenly can also change instantly. and Relax because no one is actually caring. Relax. You have money. You are living your best life. You are looking amazing. Own it. I am looking amazing. You are the most beautiful man on planet earth and you need no one else to tell you that. You have a great personality and a contagious energy.

However, I again also felt kind of purposeless on the day. I had a good time talking to mahimer and mark and then I did do a quick gym session. However, that was pretty much it. I then went for deaynes birthday party and I guesss I was carrying that burden of emptiness forward. I had the pizza and then I took them to nibe adn we jumped over the fence. I do still feel like I wasnt mentally there. Like I didnt want to be there. i felt like I had to be there. I don't know what I want to want to do. I think inside be there was a louder willingness to do something else. I think maybe it was ani? maybe somone who truly understnands and gets me is who I wanted to be with? Everyone in that room were individuals I very much did not mind being around. I just could bit care enough to actually care and communicate with. I dont want to know about them or their stories. Neither do I want to know about dwaynes. I dont care. I dont want to do haunted stories with these people. I dont want to play poker. I dont want to talk to nilab. I just simpy do not give a shit. And I feel the energy can be felt. There is an exchange. I do need to understand that I can live life completely in my terms and do only what I want to do. I did end up getting high that night after working with neel in marine commons. Was that what I really wanted to do? I believed that its what I wanted. Upon doing that, I also realized its not what I wanted to solely do. I need to fill my life with meaning and activities that make me feel like what im doing right now is correct.

But honestly, I just give a fuck. It wasnt me who did anything at all, it was all him. From the very onset, it was all him. He was showing a lot of attitude in the line and didnt give a fuck about talking to me there. Then even inside the place he very seriously said dont push me like as if I was a stranger he didnt know well. Like as if I violated his privacy or did somethign wrong. Its like he was searching for a reason and pounced on that instaneously even though for me it was to give him a taste of a thrilling experience I immersed myself into in the haunted hotel. I did feel stupid because I actually tried to patch things up/go for closure by initating that. But I just very strongly disliked the seriousness with which he said that and it really very fucking strongly reminded me of something he would do to an HPT. Piss off. Then I guess in shariqs place it did become better and then worse ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gymmed - chest only,Wednesday,11/19/2025,"call msp tomorrow - apply, What is about my mind that I have accomplished so much but yet I feel so incomplete. Is it because of the expectations you had of how it would be? What did you think it would be? What do you want it to be? It's all in your hands. What do you essentially want rishabh. And why do you want it? Like do you just want it to have friends? You think abou tit all day, all the time. It has consumed you. It has been consuming you since yesterday. Why? You dont want to be with ani. You are just forgetting how it was because the one thing you keep doing it reminising the past, thinking about how good the future would pan out if you accomplish something, but fail to live in the present. You fail to be happy at where you are. It was only 4 days ago you went to pizzeria ludica had good food etc. and enjoyed. You did discuss about how you have to find happiness not in people but in yourself and the things you can do around you. University is to find like minded people like that. Not for friends but for similar minds dude. Similar minds in a class, similar minds in a club, similar minds in a sport. Similar minds in everything around. It's not for friend bazzy. Get well read, read more, listen more, Enjoy more, program yourself. You are not a nobody. You are not invisibile. You are seen, you are felt, you are appreciated, you love yourself, you work hard on you day in and day out. You are a good person. You are just going through a rough patch.

I said 5 minutes more lets chill and he said no. THEN, he goes and has lunch for like an hour, like 5 minutes after telling me that. Then right now, he tells me ""ILL MEET YOU AFTER YOUR EXAMS END"". LIKE DUDE, IM LOCKING IN TOO FIRST OF ALL. Or we could meet to chill, like wtf. same building 2 floors apart and you say that only means one thing - IM not seeing you. I dont want to be that guy. Reverse the roles , think that if you were him and you said that, then you'd stay away too. So yeah, im done done","Just remember, everything around you is a simulation in life. Without social media and whatsapp and instagram, I would never know whats happening in someone else's life. EVER. Without reels and shorts, I would end up for sure FILLING MY TIME in with other things - whether youtube videos, friends, somethign to learn. WITHOUT YOUTUBE AND NETFLIX AND SHOWS - I would be replacing that very time with something else. I would have to. Like there is no other way. Who you meet infront of you is an interaction opportunity that you may either discount or hype based on their instagram, whatsapp, or whatever else. In actuality, every interaction should be considered without knowing anything else about them but who they are in front of you. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
